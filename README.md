# Get-Git
Get-Git is an open‑source React application that offers both a cheat sheet and flashcards to help you learn and refresh your Git knowledge. It’s a sub‑project of a broader open‑source learning platform focused on teaching the 20% of a topic you need for 80% of real‑world workflows.
You can read it from its GithubPages, [here](https://parsabordbar.github.io/get-git/)
